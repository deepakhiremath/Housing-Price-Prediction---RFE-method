# Project Name
Housing price prediction Case Study

## Project Information
This project is to do EDA and build a liner regression model to predict housing prices in an area


## EDA
	* Understanding Business Requirement
	* Understanding the data set
	* Data Cleaning 
	* Data Preparation
	* EDA
	
	
## STEPS 
	* Reading and understanding data
	* Prepare data - dummy variables, scaling
	* RFE method to find the best features
	* Train model
	* VIF calculations
	* Find residuals
	* predict on test data
	
## Conclusions
	* Developed a model with 68% accuracy, but we can make it better by adding more derived varibales
